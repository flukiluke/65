The L-BASIC programming language
======================

As you may imagine, this is a BASIC compiler. The language variant is reasonably close to QB64 (https://qb64.org) but we're willing to break compatibility with programs from 1985 when needed.

The project is itself implemented in QB64, which you will need installed to compile this project.

Build Instructions
------------------
- Edit the top of Makefile to point to your QB64 installation
- Run make

The final is 'lbasic'. Tested on Linux only but should work on Windows, more or less.
